This should print levels 0-3, with formal values of 4.
Level 4 should jump to level 8.
Finally levels 8-10 should print with formal values of -1.
Stack frame:  0   formal print =  4   formal routine =  4
Stack frame:  1   formal print =  4   formal routine =  4
Stack frame:  2   formal print =  4   formal routine =  4
Stack frame:  3   formal print =  4   formal routine =  4
Stack frame:  4   formal print = non-local jump
Stack frame:  8   formal print = -1   formal routine = -1
Stack frame:  9   formal print = -1   formal routine = -1
Stack frame: 10   formal print = -1   formal routine = -1
