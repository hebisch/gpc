Jukka Virtanen
     invented GNU Pascal in March 1988, implemented the ISO 7185 and
     most of the ISO 10206 standard, etc.

     He created all files except those listed below, based on the GCC
     source.

Dr. Peter Gerwinski (http://www.gerwinski.de/~peter/)
     added Borland Pascal related and other extensions to GNU Pascal in
     summer 1995, ported GPC to EMX, did most of the development of the
     compiler from 1996 to 2001, created the WWW home page, etc.

     He created `rts/move.pas', the files in `doc/' (together with
     Jan-Jaap), the (former) files in `config/emx/' and
     `gpc-nodes.def', and extensively modified all files.

Jan-Jaap van der Heijden
     ported GPC to DJGPP and to Microsoft Windows 95/NT, added ELF
     support in spring 1996, solved a lot of configuration and
     compatibility problems, created the GPC FAQ, etc.

     He created `Make-lang.in', `lang-options.h', `lang-specs.h', the
     files in `doc/' (together with Peter), `rts/Make*', and
     `rts/config*', and modified `module.c' and most other files.

Frank Heckenbach (http://fjf.gnu.de)
     rewrote and maintains the Run Time System since July 1997, does
     most of the development of the compiler since July 2001, wrote
     most of the units, demo programs, scripts and utilities
     distributed with GPC, wrote many test programs, maintains the GPC
     To-Do list and the WWW home page, etc.

     He created `gpc-options.h', most files in `units/', `demos/',
     `script/', `utils/' and `rts/' and many files in `test/', and
     extensively modified all files.

Waldek Hebisch
     made GPC compatible with gcc-3.1.1 and later backend versions,
     fixed backend problems on various targets and improved the
     frontend in the areas of structured initializers, qualified
     identifiers, etc.

     He created `p-tree.def', `diffs/gcc-3.*.diff' and modified
     `Make-lang.in' and all source files of the compiler as well as
     some files of the backend.

Prof. Abimbola A. Olowofoyeku ("The African Chief") (http://www.bigfoot.com/~african_chief/)
     created the original versions of many BP compatibility units in May
     1997, contributed code to other units and the Run Time System,
     helped porting GPC and the units to Cygwin, mingw and MSYS, wrote a
     number of test programs, contributed a Borland Delphi-compatible
     `SysUtils' unit (http://www.gnu-pascal.de/contrib/chief/), etc.

     He created `units/gpcutil.pas', parts of `units/system.pas' and
     `rts/fname.pas' and a number of files in `test/'.

Nicholas Burrett
     fixed some bugs and cleaned up GPC in May 1998, etc.

     He modified `expressions.c', `parse.y', `module.c' and some other
     files.

Dominik Freche
     improved and extended the GPC manual in August - September 1999 and
     wrote conversion routines for Borland compatible 6 Byte floating
     point numbers in December 1999.

     He modified `doc/en/reference.texi', `doc/en/programming.texi',
     and `units/system.pas' and created some files in `test/'.

Alexey Volokhov
     improved the performance of GPC's module/unit support in June 1997.

     He extensively modified `module.c'.

Bill Currie
     implemented more Borland extensions into GPC in July 1997.

     He modified `parse.y', `statements.c', and `predef.c'.

Nicola Girardi
     wrote the GNU Pascal Coding Standards in November 2001, contributed
     a GPC unit (http://www.gnu-pascal.de/contrib/nicola/) for the
     `svgalib' graphics library for some platforms in February 2000,
     provided some portability enhancements to the RTS.

     He created `doc/en/gpcs.texi' and modified `rts/rts.c' and created
     some files in `test/'.

Eike Lange

     Coding Standards into German and worked on the documentation.

     and `doc/en/copying-demo.texi' and modified `doc/en/gpcs.texi' and
     `doc/en/programming.texi'.

Mirsad Todorovac
     translated the GPC documentation into Croatian and contributed code
     to the run time system.

     He created all files in `doc/hr/' and several files in `test/' and
