GPC Demo Programs
*****************

These are demo programs for some of GPC's interesting features. Some
of them serve a useful purpose, and can be used as the basis for
your own programs. Others are just demos of concepts.

If you like to find out more about the features, please look into
the GPC Manual. The short demo programs you find printed in the
manual are stored in the directory `docdemos'.
